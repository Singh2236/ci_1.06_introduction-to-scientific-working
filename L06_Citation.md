## Credits in Science

### Why they are important?

The recognition of a scientist in their community of science is often the
credential to be able to get

- Financial Funding
- Higher ranking on application for an open position
- Applications for open positions
- Higher ranking for submissions of publications at conferences and journals

âž¥ In short: **Credits** are **Fame** in the science community

### What are credits in science?

The main source of **credits** for scientists is recognition of their work.
The more their work is known in the science community, the more credits they
get.

### How to get/give credits?

How to measure the spread of knowledge about a specific work?

To be able to given an answer to this question the science community established
a formal requirement _(derifed from ethics in science)_.

It is common sense in science publications, that pre-research existing work and
publications, that are used as base or in the research, are marked with their

- author
- title
- date of publication
- location of publication
  - Name of journal
  - Page numbers
- DOI (Digital Object Identifier)

to give credit to the authors of the used work.

This marking is called citation in scientific publications.

### Correct form of citation

The citation are done in two types

- In-Text Citation
- Direct quote

#### In-Text Citation

Refers to the situation that an author wants to reason about a point and
emphasize the reason, by mention existing work as a proof.

**Example:**

According to (Wikipedia:Citation Nov. 2019) a combination of in-body citation
and bibliographic entries are citations.

#### Direct Quote

Refers to  the situation that an author wants to use a part of text from an
existing work.
If this form is used the **quoted text** must be an excact copy of the text in
the quoted work, with the same errors.
In direct quotes, no modifcations to the text quoted are allowed.

**Example:**

> "... Generally the combination of both the in-body citation and the
> bibliographic entry constitutes what is commonly thought of as a citation ..."
> (Wikipedia:Citation Nov. 2019)

#### Style of Citations

There are several forms, how a previous work and its authors are cited:

- APA _(American Psychological Association)_
- MLA _(Modern Language Association)_
- Chicago/Turabien style
- Harvard/Harvard-Canterbury

Beside that in most styles there is a _bibliography_ section in an appendix.

Independent of the style used in a document, it should be consistend in the
whole document and not mixed.

#### APA

The APA Style originated in 1992 out of a group of psychologists,
anthropologists and business managers related to psychological entities.

The APA Style states, that there must be three kind of informations must be
included in in-text citations.

1. The main authors last name
2. Date of publication
3. Only in _direct quotes_ page number of quoted text

It also defines the style of references in the bibligraphy section for several
types of materials.

**Example a book in print:**

Tanenbaum, A. S.; Bos, H. (2015). _Modern operating systems_. Boston:
Pearson

#### MLA

Is a style used in works on language and literature. This style defines several
different styles for _in-text_ and _direct quote_ citations.

Out of the wide range of source types used in works on language and/or
literature, there is a need to be able to correctly record all needed
informations about a source.

Therefore it is not possible to list examples for all this types here.
For more information have a look at the MLA official website.
It has tools and guides to build correct citations and references for all types
of possible sources in this branch of science.

#### Chicago / Turabien

This is the oldest style and has been defined and published by the Chicago
University Press in 1906.

It defines two types of notations

1. Notes and Bibligraphy

  This notation uses on page notes (mentions on the bottom of a page) and a
  bibliography in the appendix.

2. Author-Date

  This notation denotes a reference in the same mannor as shown in APA style and
  a bibliography in the appendix.

**Example of a website in notes notation:**

_First Note:_

Note 1: "Google Privacy Policy", last modified March 11, 2009,
http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacypolicy.html.

_Duplicate Note later:_

"Google Privacy Policy".

_Bibliography:_

Google. "Google Privacy Policy". Last modified March 11, 2009.
http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacypolicy.html

**Example a website in Author-Date notation:**

_In-Text Reference:_

(Google 2009)

_Bibliography:_

Google. 2009. "Google Privacy Policy". Last modified March 11, 2009.
http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacypolicy.html

#### Harvard / Harvard-Canterbury

The harvard style is a more loose style and the exact definition, punctuation
and informations about a source to include may vary by country and/or
institution.

In general this style uses in-text citations without footnotes (notes on page
bottom).
Commonly the main authors last name is used and in parenthesis the publication
date.

For _direct qoutes_ the page numbers prefixed with `p. ` is added to the
publication date.

Additionally it allows to cite citations. Example: _Smith (1993, quoted by Gibbs
1998, p. 78)_

The bibliography entries in this style are similar to Chicago and APA style.

#### Citation in thesis in germany

Especially in Germany there are some additional requirements.

If citing a often changing source (ex. website), a copy of the source in
question must be supplied in an open readable format. (ex. PDF)
