# Introduction to scientific working

## Structure of a science document

Research publications mostly use a similar structure of the content.
This allows readers of these documents to have a familiar orientation in the
document.
It also provides the writer with the state of mind, to structure their thoughts
that readers can follow more easily.

### Basic structure

1. Abstract
2. Introduction
3. Materials and Methods
4. Results
5. Discussion
6. Conclusion
7. Future Work

#### 0. Title/Legal/Thanks

Depending on the type of work _(ex. bachelor thesis or phd)_ there are some
sections at the beginning of the document, that are left out in research
publications:

##### 0.1 Title Page

The title page of a _thesis_ includes the name of the thesis, the institute at
which it is submitted.
The authors of the document and also the chair (if any) of the institute.
Furthermore the examiners are listed with their full name, title
and position at the institute.

Supervisors are not listed at the title page.
Often one of the examiner are also the supervisor and could be get a sentence as
a thanks in the _thanks section_.
If not, they should get a special paragraph as a _honorable mention_.

In research publications, there is often no _title page_.
Instead the _title_ of the document together with a list of authors and the
abstract (in this order) are put in front of the _Introduction_.

##### 0.2 Legal Statements (Declaration of Own Work)

with a statement that declares the following document as **own** work and if a
part/section/information or other things in this document used, are not **own**
work, it is marked and the original author(s) are named.

This statement has some significant impact, if parts of the document are not
**own** work and there is no correct crediting for this work.

##### 0.3 Thanks section, honorable mentions

Often in _thesis_ documents this section also includes some short paragraphs
to thank people that helped in the work or document, but are not an author of
this document.

#### 1. Abstract

The Abstract is a short preamble at  the beginning of a document (mostly
before an index) describing the content of the document.
It should not be more then half a page and at least two paragraphs.

#### 2. Introduction

This section of the document _introduces_ all necessary information to
understand the upcoming research/work.
It includes all _state-of-the-art_, tools used and other needed information
for the reader.
It gives also the motivation for this work.
And desrcibes and presents the structure of the presentation of the work in
the next section.

##### 2.1 Motivation

This is a section describing the environmental situation and questions that lead
this research.
It also gives the intention of this research and the questions that should be
answered by this research work.

âž¥ Means: Here the hypothesis and its root cause is presented.

##### 2.2 State-of-the-Art

This section lists and explains already existing science and solutions to the
questions.
It also reasons and shows why these solutions are not sufficient.

##### 2.3/.../2.n Introduction to information

Subsequent sections to _state-of-the-art_ cover the tools and information used,
that a reader needs to understand, to follow/understand the work of the
document.

These informations/tools are described in an objective mannor.
A focus of the introduction on how this is concret used in this work should be
avoided.

Also if modifactions or extensions are needed, that this information/tool is
usable for the work in this document, this circumstance should only be
mentioned and explained in more detail in the next section.

#### 3. Materials and Methods

At the beginning a short overview of the subsections and its purposes are given.

After this, the section presents the research in sufficient detail that, other
scientists can reproduce and replicate the research.

Here are all developed tools, created or invented methods and used informations
described.
This section is also shows the modifications or extensions made to the tools,
informations or methods.
   
#### 4. Results

Description of the found results and how data from the experiments is analysed
is presented in this section.
Some Journals ask the writer of a publication to place this and the following
section before the **Materials and Methods** section.

#### 5. Discussion

This section reasons about the meaning of the results and their application in
the field of science of this research.

#### 6. Conclusion

This section presents the outcome of the work, by relating it to the
motivation in introduction and reason about the consequences/impact to the
science field and/or research subject.

#### 7. Future Work

The _future work_ section is often optional and a personal, less formal
section.
In this ideas to improve the research if done a second time is presented.
And also new questions the outcome of this research introcduces are listed.

#### 8. Appendix

##### 8.1 References

This section lists all used previous work mentioned in this document.

##### 8.2 Additional Informations

The _Additional Informations_ section is a place at the end of a science
document that includes all informations like

- Lists
- Images
- Program-Code Snippets
- ...

that help in understanding the work, but to long to include in the main sections
of the document.
Or they are put in this section to prevent the document to be too cluttered and
hard to read.
